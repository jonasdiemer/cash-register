  - Price
  - Stock quantity
- Edit and delete products
- Sorting by name, price, and stock
- Automatic stock updates during sales

### 3.2 Cash Register Process

- Barcode scanning via webcam
  - Automatic detection
  - Configurable scan area
  - Camera preview

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Frontend Stack

- **Svelte with TypeScript**
  - Using pnpm as package manager
  - Rationale:
    - Simple, clean code with minimal boilerplate
    - Built-in reactive state management
    - Excellent performance
    - Good TypeScript support
    - Smaller learning curve compared to React

- **State Management**
  - Svelte's built-in stores
  - Rationale:
    - Native to Svelte
    - Simple to use
    - Perfect for our use case
    - Good TypeScript integration

- **UI Framework**
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Rationale:
    - Flexible styling capabilities
    - Good print style support
    - Utility-first approach for rapid development
    - Easy adaptation for child-friendly design

### 4.2 Data Storage

- **IndexedDB with Dexie.js**
  - For product data and transaction history
  - Rationale:
    - Wrapper simplifies IndexedDB usage
    - Good TypeScript integration
    - Promise-based API
    - Efficient indexing and queries

- **localStorage**
  - For settings and UI preferences
  - Rationale:
    - Simple key-value storage
    - Sufficient for configuration data
    - Wide browser support

### 4.3 Barcode Processing

- **zbar.wasm**
  - For barcode recognition
  - Rationale:
    - Excellent performance through WebAssembly
    - Wide format support
    - Pure client-side processing

- **MediaDevices API**
  - For camera integration
  - Rationale:
    - Native browser API
    - Simple integration with Svelte
    - Good performance

### 4.4 Internationalization

- **i18n Solution**
  - svelte-i18n
  - Rationale:
    - Native Svelte integration
    - Support for multiple locales
    - Easy to use with TypeScript
    - Handles pluralization and formatting

- **Translation Structure**
  - Separate JSON files for each language
  - Translation keys organized by feature
  - Support for interpolation
  - Number and currency formatting

### 4.5 UI Components

- Tab-based navigation
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Separate print styles
- Component structure:
  - Shared Components (Buttons, Inputs, etc.)
  - Feature-based Components (Scanner, Cart, etc.)
  - Layout Components (Header, Navigation, etc.)
  - Page Components (Inventory, Register, Settings)

## 5. Development Phases

2. Data persistence (IndexedDB integration)
3. Translations for all inventory-related features

### Phase 3: Register Functions

1. Barcode scanner integration
2. Register interface
3. Payment processing
4. Translations for register operations

### Phase 4: Output

1. Receipt display
2. Print functionality
3. Display/Print styling
4. Translations for receipts

### Phase 5: Refinement

1. Settings completion
2. Feedback systems
3. Error handling
4. Testing and optimization
5. Translation review and completion

## 6. Potential Challenges

1. Barcode scanner configuration for different webcams
2. Print layout optimization
3. Offline functionality
4. Browser compatibility
5. Maintaining consistent translations
6. Handling of currency formats in different locales

## 7. Future Extension Possibilities

1. Professional mode
2. Multiple stores
3. Extended statistics
4. Import/Export of inventory data
5. Customizable receipt templates
6. Additional languages

## 8. Technical Requirements

- Modern browser with:
  - IndexedDB support
  - WebRTC (camera access)
  - localStorage
- Webcam for barcode scanning (optional)
- Printer for receipt output (optional)

## 9. Security Aspects

- Secure camera permissions
- Local-only data storage
- No sensitive data
